        "Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        " - OOP is a programming style that organizes code into self‑contained “objects” which bundle both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        " - A class specifies the structure and behavior that all objects created from it will share it defines which properties (data) and actions (methods) those objects must possess.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        " - An object in Object‑Oriented Programming (OOP) is a concrete instance of a class, representing a real-world or abstract entity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " - ABSTRACTION\n",
        "*  Defination - Abstraction hides the complex implementation details and exposes only the essential features or behavior of a system. It focuses on what something does, not how it does it.\n",
        "*  Purpose - Simplifies complex systems by providing a high-level interface, reducing cognitive load when using or integrating components\n",
        " - ENCAPSULATION\n",
        "*  Definition: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single class, and restricting direct access to an object’s internal state—typically using access modifiers.\n",
        "*  Purpose: Protects the object’s integrity by controlling how data is accessed or modified, and helps manage complexity at the implementation level.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        " - Dunder methods are special methods in Python with names that both start and end with double underscores, such as __init__, __str__, __add__, and __len__ etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        " - Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (called a subclass or derived class) inherits attributes and methods from another class (the superclass or base class), establishing an \"is‑a\" relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        " - Polymorphism is a foundational OOP principle that allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were instances of a common superclass or interface, each responding to the same method call in its own way. In essence, it enables one interface to represent many forms.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        " - Encapsulation in Python is a fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept that involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        " - In Python, a constructor is a special method named __init__() that is automatically called when a new object is created from a class. Its primary purpose is to initialize the object's attributes, setting up its initial state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        " - Class Method\n",
        "*  Definition: A class method is a method that receives the class as its first argument, conventionally named cls. It is defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "*  Access: Class methods can access and modify class-level attributes but cannot access instance-specific attributes.\n",
        " - Static Method\n",
        "*  Definition: A static method is a method that does not receive any implicit first argument (neither self nor cls). It is defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "* Access: Static methods cannot access or modify instance-specific or class-specific attributes. They are self-contained and operate solely on the parameters passed to them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        " - Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        " - Method overriding is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        " - The @property decorator in Python is a built-in function that allows you to define methods in a class that can be accessed like attributes. This provides a way to manage attribute access, enabling features such as data validation, lazy evaluation, and the creation of backward-compatible APIs without modifying the class’s public interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        " - Polymorphism is a cornerstone of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), offering several key advantages that enhance code flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        " - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is designed to serve as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses, ensuring a consistent interface while still allowing the subclasses to provide specific implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        " - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several key advantages that enhance software development processes, particularly for large-scale and complex applications.\n",
        " - Key Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming\n",
        "*  Modularity\n",
        "*  Code Reusability\n",
        "*  Encapsulation\n",
        "*  Abstraction\n",
        "*  Inheritance\n",
        "*  Scalability\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        " - In Python, class variables and instance variables are both used to store data within a class, but they differ in scope, initialization, and behavior.\n",
        " - Class Variables\n",
        "*  Definition: Class variables are attributes defined within a class but outside any instance methods. They are shared among all instances of the class.\n",
        "*  Initialization: Declared directly within the class body, typically before any instance methods.\n",
        "*  Access: Accessed using the class name or through any instance. However, modifying them via an instance can lead to unexpected behavior.\n",
        "*  Use Case: Ideal for attributes that should have the same value across all instances, such as a constant or a counter.\n",
        " - Instance Variables\n",
        "*  Definition: Instance variables are attributes specific to each instance of a class. They are defined within instance methods, typically the __init__ constructor.\n",
        "*  Initialization: Assigned within instance methods using the self keyword.\n",
        "*  Access: Accessed via the instance using self. Each instance has its own copy of these variables.\n",
        "*  Use Case: Suitable for attributes that vary between instances, such as a person's name or an object's dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        " - Multiple inheritance in Python is a way for a class to inherit from more than one parent class, allowing it to combine attributes and methods from multiple sources—a flexibility not permitted with single inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        " - __str__ – for users (informal, readable):\n",
        "*  Returns a clean, friendly string that’s meant for end users.\n",
        "*  Used by print(obj) and str(obj).\n",
        " - __repr__ – for developers (formal, unambiguous):\n",
        "*  Returns a detailed string, ideally valid Python code, that helps recreate the object.\n",
        "*  Used by repr(obj) and when an object is inspected in interactive mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        " - The super() function in Python is pivotal for writing clean, maintainable object‑oriented code—especially when you're dealing with inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The __del__() method in Python, often called a destructor (or more accurately, a finalizer), gives an object one last opportunity to perform cleanup before it’s destroyed by the garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        " - @staticmethod\n",
        "*  A static method takes no special first argument—no self, no cls.\n",
        "*  It behaves like a normal function scoped within a class, for organizational clarity.\n",
        "*  Cannot access instance attributes nor class state unless referred explicitly by class name.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        " - When a subclass overrides a method defined in its parent class, Python uses dynamic dispatch or dynamic binding—it chooses the correct version of the method at runtime based on the actual object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        " - Method chaining enables successive method calls on an object by having each method return the object itself (self) or another relevant object, enabling the next call. Think of it like sending the same object down a chain of operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The __call__ method is a special (magic) method that allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function—i.e., instance(...) triggers instance.__call__(...). This means objects can exhibit function-like behavior.\n"
